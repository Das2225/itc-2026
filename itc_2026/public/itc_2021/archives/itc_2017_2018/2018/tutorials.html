                                                In this tutorial, we will start by covering the basics of machine learning. We will proceed to give a brief overview of
                                                the new and exciting field of deep learning. We will show how easy it is
                                                to try using machine learning and deep learning, thanks to powerful, free
                                                libraries. After offering the required background in machine learning, we
                                                will review several important papers in the field of DFT, diagnosis, yield
                                                learning, and root cause analysis, which use machine learning algorithms
                                                for solving various problems. Finally, we will propose future research directions
                                                in the area of testing, where we think machine learning (especially deep
                                                learning) can make a big impact.

                                                Given today’s fast growing automotive semiconductor industry, this tutorial will discuss the implications of automotive
                                                test, reliability and functional safety on all aspects of the SOC lifecycle,
                                                while accelerating time to market for automotive SOCs. The SOC lifecycle
                                                stages will include design, silicon bring-up, volume production, and particularly
                                                in-system test. Today’s automotive safety critical chips need multiple in-system
                                                self-test modes, such as power-on self-test and repair, periodic in-field
                                                self-test during mission mode, advanced error correction solutions, etc.
                                                This tutorial will analyze these specific in-system test modes and the discuss
                                                the benefits of using ISO 26262 including its 2nd edition (to be published
                                                in 2018), in order to ensure that standardized functional safety requirements

                                                The increasing complexity and integration of IPs on modern SOCs are creating new challenges for test access mechanisms (TAM)
                                                on these devices. Direct access of the IPs for test is not only prohibitive
                                                in terms of design cost, but also adds up to the cost of testing the device.
                                                For the large SoCs, a scalable TAM is required that can provide the mechanism
                                                to access multiple and replicated digital cores, memory arrays as well as
                                                Analog and Mixed signal IPs on the chip. The architectures should also provide
                                                sufficient bandwidth as well so as to be able to reduce the overall time
                                                required to test the chip. In this tutorial we will cover major architectures
                                                available for designing TAM, suitable for devices ranging across the smallest
                                                IoT device to large servers. In addition, we will give an overview of the
                                                standards and best practices and the analysis for coming up with a robust
                                                TAM infrastructure for different kinds of SOC. The DFT practitioner will
                                                get a holistic overview of TAM architecture, methodology and best-practices.

                                                This tutorial aims at understanding the increasing use of system level tests to screen smartphone and notebook processors
                                                for manufacturing defects by taking an in-depth look at the limitations of
                                                state-of-the-art scan test methodology.
                                                <br>
                                                <br> ICs and SOCs have long been tested using low cost scan based structural
                                                tests to screen out defects post manufacturing. Recently, the new cell-aware
                                                IC test methodology has received much publicity because of its success in
                                                screening significant defectivity missed by tests generated using the traditional
                                                stuck-at and transition delay fault (TDF) fault models. However, these tests,
                                                even when further supplemented by additional tests generated by other new
                                                fault models such as gate exhaustive, still appear unable to detect many
                                                defects in the current generation of microprocessor and smartphone SOCs.
                                                Today, these applications are increasing relying on an additional test insertion
                                                during the test and packaging flow, incorporating expensive system level
                                                tests (SLTs), as a final screen for defective devices. Mobile phone SOCs,
                                                for example, are temporarily mounted on specially designed, reusable, phone
                                                test boards, and a broad range of functional applications are run over a
                                                period of 10 to 15 minutes as a final check of full functionality. Similar
                                                SLT testing is also performed on many laptop and notebook processor SOCs.
                                                However, while these system level tests do screen out a significant number
                                                of defective parts, they do not provide a complete test in themselves. Such
                                                functional tests have long been known to miss many manufacturing defects
                                                reliably detected by traditional scan tests. This rules out any possibility
                                                of eliminating conventional structural testing when SLTs are used. Consequently,
                                                industry’s effort towards reducing test costs are focused on improving traditional
                                                scan based structural tests to minimize the need for the expensive SLTs where
                                                possible. SLTs are often indispensable early in production when yields are
                                                low; the goal typically is to reduce use of these tests as the process matures
                                                and stabilizes. This requires a good understanding of the classes of defects
                                                that are uniquely detected by SLTs so that structural tests may be enhanced
                                                to cover these test escapes.
                                                <br>
                                                <br> This tutorial categorizes the failures detected by the final system level
                                                tests into four broad classes: (1) Hard defects (shorts and opens) that escape
                                                scan structural tests. (2) Latent defects (smaller manufacturing flaws that
                                                result in “burn-in” or early life failures over time) that do not manifest
                                                as functional defects during the initial scan test but are stressed to failure
                                                during the relatively long SLTs. (3) Failures due to delay defects and process
                                                related timing marginalities that are missed by the scan delay tests. (4)
                                                False alarms that incorrectly flag a good part as faulty. State-of-the-art
                                                structural test methodologies for each of these “fault” classes will be discussed
                                                in depth to understand the specific type of “defects” that can escape, and
                                                what additional tests may be needed to improve defect coverage. We particularly
                                                focus on classes (1) and (3) as described below, because they appear to be
                                                the primary drivers of the need for system level tests.

                                                The amount and complexity of Analog and mixed-signal (AMS) and RF components in SoCs have considerably increased with SOCs
                                                increasingly designed for Automotive, Industrial and Embedded Processing
                                                applications. Big SOCs are often dominated by such components, which in turn
                                                increase the overall test complexity, test time, time required for silicon
                                                debug and characterization, and adversely affect achievable test quality.
                                                There has been tremendous improvement in testing methods and detecting defects,
                                                modeled as faults, in digital circuits over the last 20 years using proven
                                                techniques, such as stuck-at faults and scan based testing. However, there
                                                is no industry standard analog fault model till date for AMS circuits. Several
                                                IC design companies started building their own analog fault models integrated
                                                either with their in-built or third party simulators. Even after such efforts
                                                targeted towards analog fault simulation, the number of test escapes, also
                                                known as Defective Parts per Million (DPPM), has not reduced beyond a certain
                                                level since 2012.
                                                <br>
                                                <br> There were some techniques proposed and implemented by various Industries
                                                and Academia, and one or more of them are also in use by few mixed-signal
                                                IC design companies. Techniques such as multisite testing have been applied
                                                with success to reduce test time by sharing instruments among multiple Devices
                                                under Test (DUT). However, they are reaching their economical limitations
                                                and have agreed to novel directions to be explored. Methods such as Random
                                                sampling, Likelihood-weighted random sampling (LWRS) are currently in use,
                                                though they potentially exercise only a small subset of all possible defects.

                                                With the globalization of IC design ﬂow, many fabless companies outsource the fabrication of their design to off-site foundries.
                                                As these foundries may not always be trusted, it results in security vulnerabilities
                                                and threats such as counterfeiting, IP piracy, reverse engineering, overbuilding,
                                                and insertion of Hardware Trojans. Logic encryption has emerged to be a potential
                                                solution to secure the design against these threats. It introduces obfuscation
                                                by inserting some extra hardware into a circuit to hide its functionality
                                                from unauthorized users. Correct functionality of an encrypted design depends
                                                upon the application of right keys, shared only with the authorized users.
                                                In the recent past, extensive efforts have been devoted to extracting the
                                                secret key of a logically encrypted design. At the same time, several countermeasures
                                                have also been proposed by the research community to thwart different state-of-the-art
                                                attacks on logic encryption. Although several countermeasures can prevent
                                                different attacks separately, however, the contradictory requirements of
                                                these countermeasures inhibit the researchers from coming up with a single
                                                solution which can thwart all the state-of-the-art attacks. As the vulnerability
                                                to at least one attack is sufﬁcient enough to compromise the secret key,
                                                one cannot claim a logic encryption technique is secure until it is capable
                                                of preventing all the contemporary attacks. Therefore, it has become extremely
                                                challenging to devise a single logic encryption technique which can thwart
                                                all the state-of-the art attacks and simultaneously fulﬁlls other fundamental
                                                criteria like high output corruption for wrong keys, low design overhead,
                                                and low implementation complexity.
