<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#0000CD;">Title: Mobile Evolution - Challenges for Test </span></h3>

<p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> 
The rapid proliferation of mobile technologies in the last few years and the projected growth of IoT devices in the coming years has thrown up new challenges for the semiconductor design industry. While increased performance & functionality have driven the need for more integration, there has been a constant pressure on the production costs to maintain the profitability of these products. New process technology nodes are being adopted almost on a yearly cadence to keep pace with these seemingly conflicting product requirements. Test technology is a key enabler in this push for product scaling by playing an important role in yield learning and the quality of shipped devices. This keynote will highlight the trends in the mobile and IoT semiconductor markets, the challenges that it poses for test and calls for solutions to make the right tradeoffs in the test methodologies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Biodata:</b> Srini Maddali is Vice President , Technology at Qualcomm India Design Center and leads the Mobile SoC development Engineering teams. His current areas of focus is Low-Power, High-Performance SoC design and enabling rapid ramp to volume of these designs.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#0000CD;">Title: Why You Want Test to Become an Afterthought, Again </span></h3>

<p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> 
Nobody in the electronics test industry actually wants test to be an afterthought.  When test has been an afterthought and technology advances and discontinuities occur, it has been very painful and expensive.  In response, the test industry has come up with new methodologies, infrastructures and automation.  These result in the test activities shifting earlier and with more automation in the design flow to the point they become almost transparent.  Test professionals are able to work at a different level of abstraction.  Scan technology shifted the work of test practitioners such that they can focus on pattern generation operations and not need to know the specific function of the design being tested.  We are in the middle of a few new shifts which bring more standard DFT methodologies and practices into earlier steps in the design flow. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Biodata:</b> Ron Press is the technical marketing director of the Tessent product family at Mentor Graphics Corp. As a 30-year veteran of the test and DFT industry, Ron has presented seminars on DFT and test throughout the world. He is a member of the International Test Conference (ITC) Steering Committee, and a Golden Core member of the IEEE Computer Society, and a Senior Member of IEEE.  Ron has patents on reduced-pin-count testing, glitch-free clock switching, and on 3D DFT.
Ron started his work in the test industry at Raytheon Company working on test and consulting throughout the company on test and built-in test.  He co-developed the Testability Design Rating System (TDRS) for the US Air Force and received the Raytheon inventor's award for a system built-in test analysis system.  Ron led the development of a state-of-the-art RF/digital tester at Harris RF when he joined them in 1995.  He joined the Mentor DFT organization in 1997.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Principal Engineer , Intel</h5>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#0000CD;">Title:<b> </b> Design optimizations and challenges of computing systems </span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> The interconnected world and cloud computing demands insatiable performance from the warehouse scale computing infrastructure. Modern datacenters are composed of racks and racks of microprocessor units interconnected with massive data storage subsystems on a hyper fast network. These facilities demand huge power delivery and cooling requirements driving up the total cost of ownership. With datacenter operating costs dominated by energy, a  highly agile system design supporting both highest performance for peak demand and best-in-class performance/Watt overall is essential. Over the past decade, higher performance at silicon level have come from sophisticated processors becoming adaptive, self-optimizing units that squeeze ever-more performance at a given power budget. Silicon optimization, reliability, configurability, and management are therefore essential to increase performance to meet the computing demands. All these pose huge design challenges and opportunities in methodologies, configuration knobs, HVM & test domain to eke out last ounce of power-performance for datacenter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Biodata:</b> Mahesh Kumashikar is a technologist and principal engineer with Scalable CPU Development Group in Bangalore. He is currently working on defining next generation server products and most recently worked as technical lead on design of Broadwell-DE and Broadwell-SP server products.
